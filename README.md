# OSlab-helper

Are you tired of typing cd a million times just to run a hello world program in xsm? Worry not, cuz I have a solution for you. I made this script with help of which you can access all the expos tools where ever you want. Just copy this zip file into your myexpos folder, unzip it, and run the `install.sh` script, which automatically installs the application. Feel free to delete the installation zip-file and folder after you are done with your setup. 

NOTE that this script only works for bash shell.

``` bash
# Make sure you are in myexpos directory before executing these commands 
curl -o oslab_script.tar.gz https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nithinraj04/OSlab-helper/refs/heads/main/oslab_script.tar.gz
unzip oslab_script.tar.gz
cd oslab_script_install
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
