Are you tired of typing cd a million times just to run a hello world program in xsm? Worry not, cuz I have a solution for you. I made this script with help of which you can access all the expos tools where ever you want. Just copy this zip file into your myexpos folder, unzip it, and run the `install.sh` script, which automatically installs the application. Feel free to delete the installation zip-file and folder after you are done with your setup.
